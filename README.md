## Getting Started With Flutter
This project can be a starting point for a Flutter developer. 

For help getting started with Flutter, view official
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

You can use the [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/) playground for experimenting with basic stuff.
